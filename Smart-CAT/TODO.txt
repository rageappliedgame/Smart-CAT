[DONE]

 1) DONE - Replace arff file/IO creation (using weka) by https://github.com/chausner/ArffTools so weka is only used for ML itself.
 2) DONE - ConsoleDialog does not show text (write small test program). TraceListener seems to work properly.
 3) DONE - Add new analysis button at the end that jumps to ML Optimization step.
 4) DONE - Remove Labeling screen
 5) DONE - Combine all Automatic ML steps into a single one.
 6) DONE - Compentency -> Just a label
 			 Facet -> Just a label
			   Variable(s) (picked of header of xlsx) -> MultiSelect Checbox.
 7) DONE - ML Only NaiveBayes and Deciscion Tree (remove other two methods as well in the code).
 8) DONE - Port Deciscion Tree case statements.
 9) DONE - Disabled unused ECD's Task/TaskModel is not used.
10) DONE - Disabled unused ECD's EvidenceModel?
11) DONE - Bound Observable Mapper /Definitions to ECD.
12) DONE - Pruned Data and removed constructors using other Data fields.
13) DONE - Using imported xlsx in the whole wizard.
14) DONE - IniFiles for output.
15) DONE - Added GroupedComboBox. 
			See https://www.brad-smith.info/blog/projects/dropdown-controls and 
			See https://github.com/BradSmith1985/DropDownControls
16) DONE - Remove 'Prob for class' from ini files
17) DONE - Link Competencies\Facets and variables to data structures.
18) DONE - Make sure the ML functionality is called at the correct spots.
19) DONE - Visualize output.
20) DONE - Show performance with a tree combobox above (comptencies and their facets).
21) DONE - Add visualization as result (tree combobox as seelector and a histogram with bucket intervals).
22) DONE - Flow might be better if we ask to generate labels or not and then run analysis straith on.
23) DONE - Endless progressbar next to Next button.
24) DONE - Link ML Optimalization choice to SelectMLforCompetencies choices.
25) DONE - Before ML Analysis an optional step Labelling (that runs only once).
26) DONE - Runs before ML. Other clustering can be removed.
27) DONE - Rename ECD Configuration header to Statistical Model.
28) DONE - Automatically label before running analysis.
29) DONE - Add Uni-Dimensional Competencies to GroupedListBox for graph display.
29) DONE - Add check for at least one value of each (0,1,2) in DecisionTreesAccord_C (old checkClass1/2/3 code).
30) DONE - Complete Porting of reading arff to ArffTools.
31) DONE - Remove dependency on Weka and IVKM.
32) DDNE - Add logging to errorBox.
33) DONE - Added Exception Dialog.
34) DONE - Use a temporary copy of the input spreadsheet.
35) DONE - Output Raw Data from test data (should match indexes).
36) DONE - Loading and Saving ECD settings no longer use hardcoded filenames.

2022
37) DONE - Explicitly change the EPPlus license to non commercial.
38) DONE - Fixed incorrect logging of the ini file loaded by default. Utils.MakePathRelative was corrected.
39) DONE - Fixed an issue with the index of the first worksheet (changed in v5) being 1 instead of 0.
40) DONE - Color Facets Red if they do not have items selected yet.
41) DONE - Disable Add/Edit/Remove Facet Menuitems when no item is selected (so we do not know the group/competency).

42) DONE - Fixed installation issue on BV5/6 (use escaped backward slashes and test for homedrive existence)
43) DONE - Cleared statistical model definition when loading a new file (after Start New).
44) DONE - Renamed GSAT Tab to Smart-Cat.
45) DONE - Added Model to Output Spreadsheet for documentation.

[TODO]
- Running GameLogs again showed an error.
- Smart-CAT tab shows a lot of numbers added as text.

[TODO]

a) * Compute Uni-Dimensional competencies.

b) Clean Data Directory?
c) HtmlHelp (one topic/panel). Pdf as backup.

d) Show output as a table (Instance 1:0 Classified as:0 is output) part.
e) Split methods for labels/not.
f) More checks (rectangular/numeric data)
g) Why do we save the extra columns. Is it not faster to recalculate them every run?

Integrate AppCenter: https://appcenter.ms/orgs/OUNL/apps/GSAT/ (but it brings quite some dependencies).

Removed IVKM v7.2.4630.5 packages.
Removed StealthAssessmentWizard\weka.dll

Meeting with Kostas

TODO - Move Smart-Cat tab into separate sheet (original file in project folder + timestamp in filename).
	 - Add an option to load the model from such spreadsheet.
	 - Write UniModel (if present) to SpreadSheet's model sheet.
	 - Ask load existing project or start a new one (and create a folder for it if new).
	 - Remove excel files from csproj.
	 - Check if a matching model is loaded.
	 - Get rid of Tuples (replace by classes).
